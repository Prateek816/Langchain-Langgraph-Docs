Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. This process is essential for life on Earth because it forms the basis of most food chains and supports atmospheric oxygen levels.

Photosynthesis occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which absorbs energy from sunlight. This absorbed energy drives a series of chemical reactions.

The raw materials required for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide enters the plant through small openings in the leaves called stomata, while water is absorbed from the soil through the roots. Using light energy, plants convert these substances into glucose.

Photosynthesis takes place in two major stages. The first stage is known as the light-dependent reactions. During this stage, light energy is captured and used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct and producing energy-rich molecules.

The second stage is called the Calvin cycle, or light-independent reactions. In this stage, the energy produced earlier is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. Although this stage does not require light directly, it depends on products generated by the light-dependent reactions.

Glucose produced during photosynthesis serves as an energy source for plants and as a building block for growth. Oxygen released into the atmosphere is used by most living organisms for respiration.

Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would not exist. The process not only supplies energy but also maintains the balance of gases in the atmosphere.
