The French Revolution was a transformative political and social movement that reshaped France and influenced the course of European history. It challenged long-standing institutions and introduced ideas about citizenship, rights, and popular sovereignty.

Before the revolution, France was governed by an absolute monarchy under King Louis XVI. Society was divided into three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The first two estates enjoyed privileges such as tax exemptions, while the Third Estate bore most of the financial burden.

By the late eighteenth century, France faced severe economic difficulties. Years of war, including involvement in the American Revolutionary War, had drained the treasury. Poor harvests led to rising bread prices, causing widespread hunger and unrest among the population.

The French Revolution began in 1789 when the financial crisis forced King Louis XVI to summon the Estates-General, an assembly that had not met for over a century. Disputes over voting procedures quickly escalated into a broader challenge to royal authority.

As the revolution progressed, power shifted from the monarchy to various revolutionary bodies. The National Assembly abolished feudal privileges and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which emphasized liberty, equality, and fraternity.

However, the revolution was not peaceful. Internal conflicts, foreign threats, and political radicalization led to the Reign of Terror between 1793 and 1794. During this period, thousands of people were executed, including King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette.

The French Revolution eventually resulted in the end of the monarchy and the rise of new political structures. Although France experienced instability in the years that followed, the revolution permanently weakened aristocratic power and inspired democratic movements throughout Europe and beyond.
